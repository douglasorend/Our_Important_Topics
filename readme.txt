[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod allows designated membergroups the ability to mark topics as important (or not), and to be able to view the [b]GLOBAL[/b] list of topics marked as important.

Membergroups having the [b]Can Mark Topics As Important[/b] permission will be able to see a new menu under [b]Moderate[/b] called [b]Important Topics[/b], which will have a listing of the topics that were marked as important.  They will also see a new button called [b]Mark as Important[/b] for "unimportant" topics, or [b]Unmark as Important[/b] for "important" topics, in the moderator buttons area 

In order to ensure compatibility with previous versions, permission to view topics marked as important is automatically implied if permission to mark topics as important is granted.  To do otherwise doesn't make sense to me....

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Admin Settings[/u][/size][/b][/color]
Two new permissions are available in [b]Admin[/b] => [b]Members[/b] => [b]Permissions[/b] for each membergroup:
o [b]Can Mark Topics As Important[/b]
o [b]Can View Topics Marked As Important[/b]

In [b]Admin[/b] => [b]Configuration[/b] => [b]Modification Settings[/b], there is a new setting:
o [b]Where to place "Our Important Topics"[/b]
