[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod allows designated membergroups the ability to mark topics as important (or not), and to be able to view the list of topics marked as important.

Membergroups having the [b]Can Mark Topics As Important[/b] permission will be able to see a new menu under [b]Moderate[/b] called [b]Important Topics[/b], which will have a listing of the topics that were marked as important.  They will also see a new button called [b]Mark as Important[/b] for "unimportant" topics, or [b]Unmark as Important[/b] for "important" topics, in the moderator buttons area 

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Admin Settings[/u][/size][/b][/color]
